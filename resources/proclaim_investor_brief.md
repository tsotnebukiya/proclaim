# proClaim — Investor Feedback, Revenue Frames, Valuation & Raise Plan
*Prepared for internal use • Updated 2025-08-13*

---

## 1) Context
We shared a two‑paragraph description of **proClaim** (blockchain + claims automation). An investor‑group member replied with a market map, contract norms, and a positioning thesis. No MVP was shown yet.

---

## 2) Sentiment & Intent (Read)
**Overall sentiment:** *Positive‑leaning, high engagement.*  
**Mode:** Diligence, not a polite pass.  
**Signals:**
- He invested effort to map incumbents and give **how to position** guidance.
- He articulated a **“Disruption wedge”** that matches our thesis: *networked STP for “untracked” bilateral claims with shared state + atomic settlement*.
- He highlighted **regulatory tailwinds** (T+1, CSDR) and **tokenized cash** trends, implying timing is favorable.
- Implicit asks: *utility‑grade reliability*, ISO 15022/20022 coverage, low‑friction integrations (e.g., Taskize/Euroclear), and a credible **network‑seeding plan**.

**Conclusion:** He is probing for **investability**. A focused demo + crisp “how we win vs incumbents” can convert interest.

## 3) What He Explicitly Stated (Key Figures)
- **Market size (SAM, “today”):** **$100–600M ARR** (claims/penalties automation only).  
- **“This cycle” glide path (with T+1/CSDR/UK+EU changes):** **$300–800M ARR**.
- **Contract norms:** Initial term **3 years** (often 3+2); **services uplift 20–50%** of year‑1 license for integration/data mapping.
- **Per‑logo economics:** **$0.5–1.5M ARR per logo** (directional).  
- **TCV/ACV bands (inferred):**  
  - Mid‑market broker/regional bank: **$0.3–1.0M TCV/3y** ⇒ roughly **$0.10–0.33M ACV**.  
  - Tier‑1 custodian/prime: **$1–3M+ TCV/3y** ⇒ roughly **$0.33–1.0M+ ACV**.

> **Note:** He did **not** state a market‑share percentage for proClaim.

## 5) Valuation Mapping (Rule‑of‑thumb Multiples → Enterprise Value)
*(Illustrative 2025 bands; actual multiple depends on growth, NRR, margins, capital efficiency, and infra “moat”)*

- **Conservative infra:** ~**5× ARR**  
- **Base SaaS:** ~**8× ARR**  
- **Premium infra:** ~**12× ARR**  
- **Top‑decile leader:** **15–20× ARR**

**Examples:**  
- **$5M ARR:** $25M (5×) → $40M (8×) → $60M (12×) → $75–100M (15–20×)  
- **$10M ARR:** $50M → $80M → $120M → $150–200M  
- **$20M ARR:** $100M → $160M → $240M → $300–400M  
- **$40M ARR:** $200M → $320M → $480M → $600–800M

## 6) Raise Strategy for $1M (Equity & Structure)
**Target dilution:** **12–18%**  
**Negotiating floor (only if truly strategic):** **≤22%**  
**Absolute hard cap (fully‑loaded, incl. any option‑pool top‑up):** **25%**

**Implications for $1M:**
| Dilution | Post‑Money | Pre‑Money |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 12% | $8.33M | $7.33M |
| 15% | $6.67M | $5.67M |
| 18% | $5.56M | $4.56M |
| 20% | $5.00M | $4.00M |
| 22% | $4.55M | $3.55M |
| 25% | $4.00M | $3.00M |

**Structuring notes:**
- Prefer **post‑money SAFE**; set the **valuation cap** so $1M aligns to target dilution (e.g., ~15% ⇒ ~**$6.7M post** cap). Include **MFN**, modest **discount** only if necessary.  
- If a priced round: anchor **$6–8M post** (12–17% dilution).  
- If they truly unlock distribution/regulatory access: consider **performance warrants** (up to **3–5%**) that **vest only on hard milestones** (e.g., signed design partner, production pilot, revenue threshold).  
- **Board observer, not a seat** (at MVP).

**Option‑pool caution:** If investors want a **pre‑money** pool increase (e.g., +10%), that’s extra dilution. Keep the **25% hard cap as “all‑in”**.

## 7) What to Put in Front of Them Next (to Convert Interest)
1. **Laser‑focused demo** on 1–2 high‑pain claim types (e.g., manufactured dividends; tax‑rate diffs for short‑settled trades):  
   - Unstructured evidence → AI pre‑recon (when ready) → proposed settlement.  
   - **Counterparty not on network** path: bilateral shared ledger + **atomic cash leg** with **settlement choice** (bank rails or regulated tokenized cash).  
   - Show **STP/aging reduction** and **time‑to‑cash** improvements.
2. **Integration story**: ISO 15022/20022 adapters; Taskize/Euroclear on roadmap; API‑first; security/compliance posture (audit logs, entitlements, data residency).  
3. **Commercial frame** aligned to norms: 3‑year term; Year‑1 services <30% of license; **90‑day pilot → production**.  
4. **Differentiation one‑pager** vs DTCC ClaimConnect, Pirum, Meritsoft/AccessFintech/SmartStream, highlighting: **untracked bilateral claims + atomic settlement + AI co‑pilot**.  
5. **Coverage strategy:** the first **5–10 counterparties/flows** to light up; how we seed network effects.

## 8) Draft Reply to the Investor (Polished)
> Thanks for the market map—this aligns with our focus. We’re going **claims‑first, cross‑asset**, with **utility‑grade rails plus an AI co‑pilot** to ingest unstructured evidence and pre‑reconcile bilateral claims. A key differentiator is handling **“untracked” counterparties** via a shared bilateral ledger and **atomic cash legs** with **settlement choice** (bank rails or regulated tokenized cash).  
> We can walk through a focused demo on two claim types showing STP/aging impact, API‑first integration (ISO 15022/20022 adapters; Taskize/Euroclear on our roadmap), and a 90‑day pilot structure aligned to enterprise norms. We’ll also share a side‑by‑side vs incumbents to highlight our wedge. Happy to set up a session to review the demo and commercialization plan.

---

## 9) Internal Notes / Partner Message (Plain, Concise)
Numbers seem overly optimistic on ARR, which is good for us. We should ask **$1M for ~15%** and be okay landing **15–20%** only if they’re truly strategic; **hard cap 25% all‑in** (including any option‑pool). We should push for **two design partners/LOIs**. In return we deliver a tight demo on 1–2 claim types, a **90‑day pilot**, and monthly updates. **Board observer only, not a seat.**

## 10) FAQs
- **Q:** Did he say what share of SAM we can win?  
  **A:** **No.** He gave SAM bands and contract norms; any share‑of‑SAM % is our own planning assumption.

- **Q:** What revenue would we generate at 10–20 logos?  
  **A:** Using his per‑logo ARR ($0.5–1.5M): **$5–15M** (10 logos) and **$10–30M** (20 logos).

- **Q:** How should we value the business at those revenues?  
  **A:** Map ARR to **5× / 8× / 12× / 15–20×** bands for **conservative/base/premium/top‑decile** scenarios (see §5).

## 11) Quick Math (Formulas)
- **Post‑money valuation** = Investment ÷ Dilution %  
- **Pre‑money valuation** = Post‑money − Investment  
- **ACV (from TCV/3‑year)** ≈ TCV ÷ 3  
- **ARR (per logo)** ≈ ACV (if mostly subscription; exclude one‑time services)

## 12) Action Checklist (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Choose **2 claim types** for the demo; script data and evidence samples.  
- [ ] Stub **bank rails** and **tokenized cash** choice (simulate if needed).  
- [ ] Prepare **ISO 15022/20022** read‑only adapters (demo level).  
- [ ] Build **differentiation table** vs DTCC/Pirum/Meritsoft/AccessFintech/SmartStream.  
- [ ] Draft **90‑day pilot plan** (KPIs, roles, timeline, success criteria).  
- [ ] Finalize **raise terms** one‑pager (dilution bands, SAFE cap, pool policy, warrants logic).
